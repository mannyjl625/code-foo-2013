San Francisco Bay Area Gamers
=============

To come up with how many gamers I believe to be in the San Franciso
Bay Area, I took a gross estimation of the Bay Area population 
versus what percentage of the country 
are gamers, and used additional factors to refine my results.

Step 1: The Gross estimation
==

I first took the total US poplulation, about 304,000,000, as well as 
the amount of gamers in the US according to NPD's 2009 Gamer 
Segmentation Report, which is 166,000,000 and used these figues to 
calculate that about 54% of people in the US 'play games'. I then took
the popluation of the San Francisco Bay Area, which is about 
7,000,000, and applied my 55% to arrive at the estimation that about
4,000,000 of people in the Bay Area are gamers.


Step 2: Considering the demographics of the Bay Area
