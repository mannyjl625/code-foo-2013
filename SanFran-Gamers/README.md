San Francisco Bay Area Gamers
=============

To come up with how many gamers I believe to be in the San Franciso
Bay Area, I took a gross estimation of the Bay Area population 
versus what percentage of the country 
are gamers, and used additional factors to refine my results.

Step 1: The Gross Estimation
----------------------------

I first took the total US poplulation, about 304,000,000, as well as 
the amount of gamers in the US according to NPD's 2009 Gamer 
Segmentation Report, which is 166,000,000 and used these figues to 
calculate that about 55% of people in the US 'play games'. I then took
the popluation of the San Francisco Bay Area, which is about 
7,000,000, and applied my figure of 55% to arrive at the estimation 
that about 4,000,000 of people in the Bay Area are gamers.


Step 2: Considering the demographics of the Bay Area
----------------------------------------------------

Though my estimation of 4,000,000 may make sense in terms of the 
survey data, there are still many demographic factors to consider 
when evaluating the difference of the Bay Area population vs. the 
general population. Upon researching to sex and age demographics, the
the Bay area have very close percentages as far as male to female 
and breakdowns for age groups to the general US population, with 
differences of no more than 3% for any of the age or sex groups. 

San Francisco Bay Area stats
(http://www.bayareacensus.ca.gov/bayarea.htm)

Male...............49.6%

Female.............50.4%


Under 5 years.......6.3%

5-17 years.........16.0%

18-65 year.........65.5%

65 years+..........12.3%

US stats
(http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/00000.html);

Male...............49.2%

Female.............50.8%


Under 5 years.......6.5%

5-17 years.........17.2%

18-65 years..........63%

65 year+...........13.3%

With these figuerse in mind, we can safely say that the San Francisco
Bay area represents the general population well in terms of sex and 
age. Theres is, however, a significant gap in wealth between the two
groups. As of 1999, the average household incomce for the Bay Area 
was $75,000 vs. $53,000 for the general US population. Being that 
videogames are considered a normal good, that is that an increase in
income leads to an increase in demand for that product, we can assume
the demand for games in the Bay Area to be higher than average, and
as a result, more than the average amount of gamers reside there.

Step 3: Considering Unique Factors and Industry Trends
------------------------------------------------------

Keeping in mind that there may be more than the average number of 
Bay Area gamers due to the above average household income. I 
considered the areas unique role in the industry as well as changes 
in the industry since the gamer survey was taken in 2009. 

One of the most significant happenings in the games industry is the 
explosive rise of mobile gaming. While hard numbers on how much 
mobile gaming has grown since 2009 are hard to come by, super
populate mobile games such as the angyr birds series and cut the rope 
indicate that the amount of people playing mobile games is on a 
significant rise, which may result in us having a higher gamer population then just 55%.

This coupled with the fact that California is the the leading state in
in concentration of videogame-jobs and accounts for 40% of the 
industry's employment, its clear that the San Francisco Bay Arear has
a tendency to have a higher concentration of gamers than the average 
major US city. 

Step 4: My Conclusion
---------------------

With all the points that I had brought up in mind, I would offer an
educated guess that there are 4,500,000 gamers reside in the San 
Francisco Bay area, having considered the above average wealth of the
area, the rise of mobile gaming, and California's role as the center of
the industry in the US.
